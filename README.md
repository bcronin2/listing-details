# Listing Details

A full-stack React module that recreates the listing details section of an vacation rental listing page, including:

- Overview (title, type, location, host, capacity)
- Highlights
- Description
- Amenities
- Sleeping arrangements
- House rules
- Cancellation policy
- Video tour

Each of these components is populated with mock data for 100 listings. See a sample of data sent to the client here: https://gist.github.com/bcronin2/4b220cb71d18c3ca3a94afa0b39f33c9

## Tech Used

This module is built on a MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node) stack.

### System Requirements

- Node >=6.7.0 (runtime environment)
- npm >=6.0 (dependency manager)
- MongoDB >=3.0 (database)
[for linting] - Airbnb linter (install globally using ```npm i eslint eslint-config-airbnb eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-react -d```)

### Prod Dependencies (installed with npm)

- axios (sending API requests from client)
- body-parser (handling requests on server)
- cors (handling cross-origin requests from proxy)
- css-modules (modular styles)
- express (server framework)
- faker (data generation)
- mongoose (database connections)
- nodemon (running/watching server)
- prop-types (validating component data)
- react (component library)
- react-dom (rendering component)
- react-icons (rendering special icons)

An `nvmrc` file is included if using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

## Development

This module is set up to run locally at **localhost:3001/listing/[id from 1 to 100]**.

You can run this module either (1) with NPM scripts from local files, or (2) from a container on DockerHub (see more below).

**By default, the static js bundle is served from S3. To serve from localhost, change the appropriate commented-out lines in public/index.html.**

### Running with npm
In order to run with npm, you need to:

- Install dependencies
- Seed your database
- Build client bundle.js, locally and/or to S3
- Run the server

> NOTE: All commands below to be run from within the root directory

#### Installing Dependencies

```sh
npm install -g webpack
npm install
```

#### Seeding Database

```sh
npm run seed
```

#### Building Local Client Bundle

```sh
npm run build:dev
```
> NOTE: The files built in this way will only be served if you change the script tags used in public/index.html.

#### Building Client Bundle to S3

```sh
npm run build:prod
```
> NOTE: To build to S3, you will need to set up your own bucket and include an .aws.json file in this repo with your credentials.


#### Running Server

```sh
npm run start
```

> NOTE: This uses nodemon, so changes will update the server environment automatically.

### Running with Docker

In order to run with Docker, you need to:

- Create your own image on DockerHub, updating the `package.json` and `docker-compose.yml` files accordingly
- Build your image to DockerHub
- Run the `docker-compose` file
- Modify some of the scripts further if you want to work out of a locally Dockerized version

> **NOTE: You must modify the `build:docker` script in `package.json` to create images in your own account. For example:**
> Current script:
> ```sh
> docker build . -t bcronin2/fec-airbnh-details && docker push bcronin2/fec-airbnh-details
> ```
> Your script:
> ```sh
> docker build . -t YOUR_NAME/fec-airbnh-details && docker push YOUR_NAME/fec-airbnh-details
> ```
> **You must also update line 5 in `docker-compose.yml` with this new tag.**

#### Building Container to DockerHub

```sh
npm run build:docker
```

#### Running Container from DockerHub (includes seeding database)

```sh
docker-compose up [-d] ('-d' for detached mode, i.e., running in background)
```

### Maintenance

#### Testing

```sh
npm run test
```

> NOTE: The \_\_test\_\_ folder only contains API tests and config files; other integration tests and unit tests of components are in client/components. The command above runs tests from both locations.

#### Linting

```sh
npm run lint
```
